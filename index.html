        <p class="about-me">I am Logan Ayers if the header hasn't made you aware. I was born in Georgia, but have lived
            in many different locations. From Connecticut, to Ohio, to Texas, to England, I have done my fair share of
            traversing the North Western hemisphere. I have lived in Kansas for 5 years now. </p>
        <p class="about-me"> I started coding in highschool, starting with relatively easy things, like coding a card
            deck that shuffles itself or recreating Space Invader in Python. I attended the coding bootcamp at KU where
            I learned things like web design (Utilizing HTML, CSS, and Java).</p>
        <p class="about-me"> The fields I see myself most successful in are video game design and automation.</p>
