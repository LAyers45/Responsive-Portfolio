        <p class="about-me">Hello perspective employers. I am Logan Ayers I was born in Georgia, but have lived
            in various locations, both domestic and foreign. From Connecticut, to Ohio, to Texas, to England, I have
            done my fair share of
            traversing the North Western hemisphere. I have lived in Kansas for 5 years now. </p>
        <p class="about-me"> I started coding in highschool, starting with relatively easy things, like coding a card
            deck that shuffles itself or recreating Space Invader in Python. I attended the coding bootcamp at KU where
            I
            expanded my repetoire, learning full stack development.</p>
        <p class="about-me"> Coding in general has been a fulfilling past time. I enjoy analyzing a problem and figuring
            out viable solutions, in the future I plan on making my hobby into a career.</p>
